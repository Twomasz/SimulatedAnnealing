## The purpose of this project
The aim of this project is to evaluate the simulated annealing algorithm solving the problem of maximizing the profit of a certain company. <br />
The algorithm has been tested for various hyperparameters such as:
* T (offen called temperature),
* number of epochs, 
* progressive / constant number of iterations in each epoch,
* size of tested case.

## Short reminder
**Simulated Annealing** is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the global minimum of a complex function. <br />
The method is based on the concept of annealing, which is a process of slowly cooling a material to obtain a desired crystal structure.

## Problem description 
The **'XYZ'** company sells and sends parcels with car parts on an auction website (for example Allegro).
The company buys a certain amount of parts from the warehouse, and then, adding a margin, sells them at auction.
Please note that, on auction portals selling companies buy access to a certain number of auctions, and each auction may contain one type of part with a theoretically infinite number of product. <br /><br />

In this issue, the algorithm must **maximize** total profit for the company. <br />
In other words, it should choose those car parts (and quantity) that bring the best profit.
